# Cricket-Analysis

Our project aims to revolutionize IPL auction strategies by integrating ground characteristics to inform player selection. We utilize statistical analysis to categorize players based on their suitability for specific pitch conditions, such as spin-friendly surfaces like Chepauk. Using player statistics, we predict auction prices and recommend similar players tailored to franchise requirements. Our platform offers interactive tools for team composition, considering current player counts and positional needs. With a focus on data-driven decision-making and optimization, our goal is to empower franchises to build competitive teams and enhance their performance in IPL tournaments.
